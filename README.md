## Project Intruduction
It's a project used as a work for Guangdong-hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area 1st AI4S competition.It's also my first time to use the knowledge of Deep Learning to solve some Possion Equation in multi-dimension.The model was not so good,the graph may be not accurate.Through that I could find the interdiscipline between the Computer Science in the part of artificial intelligence and energy and powering engineering.
